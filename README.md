# RLE-Algorithm
A simple Run Length Encoding Algorithm

Run Length Encoding
        - It is a form of lossless data compression where a repeated string of adjacent characters are encoded in order to reduce a certain file size.
        - Has 2 main values
        - 1st value stores the number of time a character is repeated
        - 2nd value stores the character code
        - after decompression the original data should be obtained again without any data lossless

How to use the program?
  Type a string of characters and let the algorithm work its magic to compress it. Note, however that the algorithm is not 100% efficient. We here at @mellowboy are doing our   best to improve the algorithm. This is just a side project that we have been working on.
